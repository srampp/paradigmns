# Fluency (text version)
This paradimn was created with PsychoPy 3 (https://www.psychopy.org/index.html). It implements a simple fluency fMRI paradigmn according to the recommendations of the ASFNR (https://www.asfnr.org/). 

It utilizes text components to show the stimuli, which limits the possible choice of nonsense symbols. Currently, a number of Georgian and Armenian letters are used. This may of course be an issue with Georgian or Armenian speaking participants. In addition, there is some resemblance to the Latin alphabet which may motivate participants to generate words unintentionally.
